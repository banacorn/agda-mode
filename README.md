# agda-mode on Atom

For people who don't wanna use Emacs for whatever reasons.

**Feel free to open issues!!!!**

## Requirements

* Atom Packages: [language-agda](https://atom.io/packages/language-agda)
* Binaries: [agda](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Download)

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the Atom package [language-agda](https://atom.io/packages/language-agda) installed and enabled.
2. Ensure you have [agda](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Download) properly installed. Try `agda` in your console.
3. Install the package:
  * from the editor: `Atom > Preferences... > Install`, search for `agda-mode` and install
  * or from a shell: `apm install agda-mode`
4. If you have Agda installed properly (i.e. `agda` is in the [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)), check it in your console), then it's good to go.

## Recommanded Settings

### Enable Scroll Past End

Go to `Settings > Editor > Scroll Past End` and enable it to allow the editor to be scrolled past the end of the last line. The reason is that the height of the "panel" at the bottom is constantly changing, and it would be annoying if the editor jumps up and down with the panel.

## Commands

This is an exhaustive list of available commands.

| Keymap            | Command                                 | Global | Goal-specific |
|------------------:|:----------------------------------------|:------:|:-------------:|

Levels of normalization

| Prefix     | Normalization      |
|-----------:|:-------------------|
| `    `     | Simplified         |
| `C-u`      | No normalization   |
| `C-u C-u ` | Full normalization |

For example, `C-u C-c C-d` if you want to infer a type without normalizing it.
See [Agda:Issue 850](https://code.google.com/p/agda/issues/detail?id=850) for more discussion.

### Unicode Input method (only invokable under `.agda` or `.lagda`)

The key mapping of symbols are the same as in Emacs. For example: `\bn` for `ℕ`, `\all` for `∀`, `\r` or `\to` for `→`, etc.

| Keymap            | Command                     |
|------------------:|:----------------------------|
| `\\` or `alt-/`   | input symbol                |

### Commands not yet supported

| Keymap            | Command               | Reason               |
|------------------:|:----------------------|:---------------------|
| `    C-c C-x C-d` | remove goals and highlighting (deactivate) |
| `    C-c C-x M- ` | comment/uncomment the rest of the buffer | nope |



## How to contribute

### Environment Setup

1. clone the repo and load it as a development package
2. open the repo in the development mode
3. install dependencies
4. checkout to the `dev` branch. The `master` branch is for stable releases.
```
apm develop agda-mode
atom -d ~/github/agda-mode
cd ~/github/agda-mode
npm install
git checkout dev
```

The project is written in TypeScript so you would probably need these:
```
npm install -g typescript@2.2
apm install atom-typescript
```

To keep the TypeScript transpiler running while developing:

```
tsc --watch
```
